       we usually use it if there are only 2 possibilities
       two conditions only not more not less than 2 conditions. if it resolves to true the first
       code block will execute. if it is false then second code block (else) is going to run
       else means otherwise.

       if (condition){ if condition must be true
       Statement A} else { if condition must be false
       Statement B}
       if the statement A is ture cannot use else, but if it is false
       then we go to else statement.

         employed or not employed
         odd or even
         eligible or not eligible
