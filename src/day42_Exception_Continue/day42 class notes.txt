  Exception Handling:

        Un-Checked Exceptions
		1. try & catch: used for handling unchecked exceptions it is the only way to handle unchecked exceptions

				try{
					exception code
				}catch(ExceptionType e){
					e.printStackTrace();
				}

        Checked Exceptions;
        can be handled in two ways.
        1. Through applying try catch block.(recommended always)
		2. Throws keyword: This Keyword is used for handling checked exceptions ONLY

		   - Caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception



  Throw keyword: used for manually throw exception it does nothing to handle the exception.
                 it creates the exception. for some specific reason we might need to create an
                 exception (manually creating the problem). that's the time we use throw keyboard

	    syntax=	throw new ExceptionObject("it accepts a string arguments");
	        ex= throw new NoSuchElementException("No such an Element");

	   - Throw keyboard also we can only apply for checked exceptions

	    String browser = "Cydeo";
